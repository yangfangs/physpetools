Introduction Understanding phylogenetic relationships between different species is crucial for evolutionary studies. Reconstructing the phylogenetic species tree, a branching diagram, is particularly useful in inferring evolutionary relationships. For example, the tree-of-life provides a remarkable view of organizing principles of the biological world. In addition, because new organisms are being sequenced, by integrating them to already built species trees, it is important to determine their taxonomic identities. Moreover, combining with gain/loss homologous information, species trees are widely applied in predicting new members of protein complexes and protein-protein interactions. Here, we developed an easy-to-use package named PhySpeTree that is convenient to reconstruct species trees by one command line. Two independent pipelines were included by using the most adopted small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) and concatenated highly conserved proteins (HCP), respectively.

What is the input of PhySpeTree? Users only need to prepare a TXT file containing KEGG abbreviated species names. For example, organism_example_list . Now, PhySpeTree not only supported the user input three- or four-letter organism codes (KEGG database organism codes) but also the NCBI taxonomy id (for example human taxonomy id is 9606). You can search taxonomy id form NCBI taxonomy database . 2. How to explain PhySpeTree outputs? PhySpeTree returns two folders, Outdata contains the output species tree and temp includes temporary data. Files in temp can be used to check the quality of outputs in each step. If HCP method ( --hcp ) is selected, the temp folder includes: conserved_protein : highly conserved proteins retrieved from the KEGG database. alignment : aligned sequences. concatenate : concatenated sequences and conserved blocks. If SSU rRNA method ( --srna ) is selected, the temp folder includes: rna_sequence : SSU rRNA sequences retrieved from the SILVA database. rna_alignment : aligned sequences and conserved blocks. 3. What classes of HCP are selected? PhySpeTree uses 31 HCP without horizontal transferred genes according to Ciccarelli et al. . cite: Ciccarelli FD, Doerks T, Von Mering C, et al. Toward automatic reconstruction of a highly resolved tree of life[J]. science, 2006, 311(5765): 1283-1287.

How are SSU rRAN created? The SSU rRAN sequences are created from the SILVA database (Release 132, Released: 13.12.2017). Sequences haven been truncated, which means unaligned nucleotides are removed. 5. How do I use PhySpeTree when I can't connect to the Internet? When users can't connect to the Internet. They can download the HCP or SSU rRNA database to local and reconstruct species tree. SSU rRNA database: database16s.tar.gz HCP database: databasehcp.tar.gz Use $ tar -zxvf database16s.tar.gz decompress the download database.

The default is \"Outdata\". -t Number of processing threads (CPUs).

Example Build species trees by manually prepared HCP The HCP sequences belonging to the same class are prepared in one FASTA format file, and all FASTA format files are stored in the same folder. For example, the folder example_build_hcp contains 10 classes of HCP (p1~p10) corresponding to 10 different organisms. There is no limit number of HCP sequences. We recommend no less than 10 highly conserved proteins to ensure the accuracy of the reconstructed phylogenetic tree.
